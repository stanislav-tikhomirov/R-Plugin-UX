### R Plugin UX Tasks - 1

1. There are 2 files with data about national parks in California:
   * ca_np.csv - visits
   * ca_np_hotels.csv - hotels incomes
   Take a look at the data (so that you could work with it later). Then merge these two datasets into one.

2. Create 3 combined charts in R script:
   * Visitors by year (line chart), hotel income by year (bar chart) for Channel Islands National Park
   * Visitors by year (line chart), hotel income by year (bar chart) for Pinnacles National Park
   * Visitors by year (line chart), hotel income by year (bar chart) for Sequoia National Park
   
3. Create 2 pivot tables in R script:
   * Total visitors and income by park name
   * Mean visitors and income by year

4. Then out of these 3 charts and 2 pivot tables create HTML report with RMarkdown. 
   Use whatever text / headings / styles you want.

5. In ‘stocks’ folder there is FlexStocks RMarkdown file. Knit it. If there are any errors - fix them.

6. In request.R there are some bugs in the code. Use debugger to locate and fix them.
